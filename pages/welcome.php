    <h2>Welcome to Litter!</h2>
    
	<img src="./images/thisisyou.png" style="width:150px;float:right; margin-left:10px" alt="This is you!" /><p><strong>Litter</strong> is the hottest new <strong>micro-blogging service</strong> for cats all over the world. Find a new <strong>sunny spot</strong> in the living room? Finally <strong>catch that mouse</strong> you've been after? Eating a particularly <strong>tasty tuna</strong> tonight? Tell it to all your furry friends in little <strong>140 character</strong> sized updates called <strong>Litts</strong>.</p>
	<p>In this demo, you will be playing the role of Scott VonSchilling's curious tabby cat <strong>Tiger</strong>, aka Wild_Tiger. <strong>Litt out</strong> anything that's on your mind. <strong>Reply</strong> to other cats' litts. Change your <strong>settings</strong>. And stick around to see if your friend <strong>Mimi</strong> replies to any of your litts.</p>
	<p>This demo is set up from scratch specifically for you, so <strong>play around</strong> with it as much as you like. No one else will be able to see what you write, and everything will be <strong>automatically deleted</strong> off my database after two hours, or after you sign off of Litter.</p>
	<p>And of course, feel free to <strong>download</strong> the complete source code <a href="<?php echo($SRC_URL);?>">here</a>.</p>
